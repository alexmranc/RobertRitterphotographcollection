## About the Collection

This is a collection of the photos of Robert Ritter, a crewman of a B29 who is believed to have been attached to the 509th Composite Group during the Second World War. He loved photograhpy and took many photographs of his time in the United States Army Air Force. These provide a glimpse into the life of those who were part of this bomber force, a piece of history which has remarkably few photos and similarly low coverage. Many histories instead have focused on the commanders and men in charge of the operation. This collection currently contains some of his photos, but will expand to include other pieces he kept including a copy of a diner menu on the back of which he wrote a poem that the diner kept and used.
